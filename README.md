# IoT-Facial-Recognition

This repository contains the code for the facial recognition module of an IoT 'Smart Lab' system. My partner and I wanted to create a system that automated the research lab that we both work in. We focused on unlocking the lab door using a facial recognition system, which would eliminate the need for keys to get into our lab.

The facial recognition uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade algorithm to detect and analyze the subject's face. I also worked on the code which would allow the facial recognition module to interface with the main lab system, who will let the person in based on whether it recoginizes him/her as a member of the lab.
